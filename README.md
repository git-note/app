## How it works?

You take your notes with your favorite text editor 
(currently only .md and .td files are supported) 
and synchronize them with your favorite synchronization service (a git repository is a good choice).
npmnotes takes your notes and convert them into a web app that you can make public or use locally (just like the one you are at right now).


See [](https://npmnotes.org/) for more details.
