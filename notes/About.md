# About

npmnotes is a command line note organizer.

## How it works?

You take your notes with your favorite text editor (currently only .md files are supported) and synchronize/collaborate them
with your favorite synchronization service (a git repository is a good choice).
npmnotes will build a web app containing all your notes (just like the one you are at right now) that you can make public or use locally.
